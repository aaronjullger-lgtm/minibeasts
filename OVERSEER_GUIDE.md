## 🎲 Game Modes

### ⚖️ The Tribunal (Social Betting)

AI-generated superlatives based on your group's chat history. Vote on winners, bet on outcomes.

**How It Works:**
1. AI analyzes chat and generates 5 superlatives
   - Examples: "Most Delusional Take", "Best Joke", "Biggest L"
2. AI nominates 3-4 people per category with **evidence from chat**
3. AI sets **American odds** for each nominee (e.g., +150, -110)
4. Players **place bets** on who will win
5. Everyone **votes** on Sunday
6. Payouts based on odds

**Example:**
```
Superlative: "Most Delusional Take of the Week"
- Eric (+150) - "Cowboys will go 12-5"
- Elie (-110) - "I'm the main character"
- Colin (+200) - "My parlay was actually smart"

You bet 100 grit on Eric.
Eric wins the vote.
You get: 250 grit (100 + 150)
```

### 🚀 The Squad Ride (Co-Op Parlay)

One player creates a 3-leg NFL parlay. Others can "squad ride" it for a **multiplier bonus**.

**How It Works:**
1. One player selected to create parlay each week
2. Build 3-leg parlay (min +150 odds, max +1000 odds)
3. Other players can join with their own wager
4. **Multiplier increases** with each rider (+10% per rider)
5. If parlay wins, everyone gets paid with their multiplier
6. If it loses, everyone loses

**Example:**
```
Colin creates: Cowboys ML (-110) + Eagles ML (-110) + Over 47.5 (-110)
Total Odds: +550

Riders:
- Alex: 100 grit, x1.0 multiplier
- Nick: 100 grit, x1.1 multiplier (2nd rider bonus)
- Justin: 100 grit, x1.2 multiplier (3rd rider bonus)

Parlay wins!
- Alex: 650 grit
- Nick: 715 grit
- Justin: 780 grit
```

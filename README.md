## Available Minigames

The following minigames are now playable in Dynasty Mode:

### ✅ 1. "Sunday Scaries: The Parlay Revenge Game" **[IMPLEMENTED]**
**Concept:** A high-stakes betting simulator where you make increasingly dumb parlays throughout the NFL season. Every loss makes Colin roast you harder, and every win makes Elie claim he "called it."

**Why it fits:** The group is already degenerate gamblers. This leans into the parlay addiction meta and gives everyone a chance to watch their friends spiral into financial ruin in real-time.

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time roast generation based on how badly your bet is losing
- ✅ "Hater's Parlay" mode where you bet against everyone's favorite teams
- ✅ Special Colin event: "Liberal GF finds your betting history" - costs 200 grit to smooth over
- ✅ Elie's "Actually I'm Smart" multiplier that makes his losses hurt twice as much

### ✅ 2. "Commish Chaos: Spencer's Power Trip Simulator" **[IMPLEMENTED]**
**Concept:** A fantasy football commissioner management game where you abuse your power, make terrible rule changes mid-season, and desperately try to maintain control as the league revolts.

**Features:**
- ✅ Veto trades for no reason and watch the group chat explode
- ✅ Make up new scoring rules to help your team
- ✅ "The Joint Chiropractic" ad mini-game to earn emergency commish powers

### ✅ 3. "The Ty Window: A Rare Event Collector" **[IMPLEMENTED]**
**Concept:** A clicker/idle game where you wait for Ty to actually text something. When he does (The Ty Window), you have 30 seconds to screenshot it before he disappears for another week.

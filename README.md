### Game Modes

#### ⚖️ The Tribunal (Social Betting)
Vote and bet on AI-generated superlatives:
- "Most Delusional Take of the Week"
- "Best Joke"
- "Biggest L"
- "Most Out-of-Pocket Comment"
- And more, based on actual chat behavior

**How it works:**
1. AI analyzes chat and nominates 3-4 people per category
2. AI sets American-style odds (+150, -110, etc.)
3. Players place bets on who will win
4. Everyone votes on Sunday
5. Winners get paid out based on odds

#### 🚀 The Squad Ride (Co-Op Parlay)
Create or join weekly 3-leg NFL parlays:
- One player creates the parlay each week
- Others can "squad ride" with their own wager
- Each additional rider adds +10% multiplier
- If parlay wins, everyone gets paid with their multiplier
- If it loses, everyone loses together

**Example:**
```
Colin's Parlay: Cowboys ML + Eagles ML + Over 47.5 = +550
- Alex rides: 100 grit, x1.0 multiplier → 650 grit if win
- Nick rides: 100 grit, x1.1 multiplier → 715 grit if win
- Justin rides: 100 grit, x1.2 multiplier → 780 grit if win
```

#### 🏈 The Sportsbook
Standard NFL betting with Grit:
- **Spreads** (e.g., Cowboys -3.5)
- **Moneylines** (e.g., Eagles ML)
- **Over/Under** (e.g., Total Points Over 47.5)
